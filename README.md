# Dictionary
you can make your own dictionary file using crunch name it as'dictionary' or download it from above.
if you do not have crunch in your system than install it by following command.
    
    'apt-get install crunch'
 using crunch
    
    'nano | crunch [minimum length] [maximumlength] possible letters in password file1.txt '

## Packages 
do not forget to install aircrack-ng suite by writing following command in terminal 'apt-get install aricrack-ng'
## Default Working 

    './script1.sh'

    './script2.sh'

    './script3.sh'

this will take time but surely you will get the password of access point if it contains only numbers
and password is less than 10 digits

if you are preparing your own wordlist save it as 'wordlist' in same folder and remove the previous one.
